# Efficient Domain Adaptation for
Low-Resource IR Scenarios

## The Experiment is done in the experiment python notebook
1. Set up environment in Python3.12, download the requirements.txt
    `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Please create a .env file if it doesn't exist already.
3. Input your OpenAI API key as following:
    OPENAI_API_KEY=YOURKEY
4. See the experiment.ipynb notebook to run the full code.
5. Some files were too large to push on github, like the embeddings, models and rankings, but they are generated when running the code and saved in the corresponding folders.
